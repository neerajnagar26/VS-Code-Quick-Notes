# VS Code Quick Notes

A lightweight VS Code extension I created to make note-taking easier while coding.

## What it does
- Adds a command **Quick Notes: Add Note** to the Command Palette.
- Lets you quickly type a note and automatically saves it into a `NOTES.md` file inside the workspace.
- Keeps all TODOs and ideas in one place without leaving the editor.

## Why I built it
When working on experiments or coding tasks, I often needed a fast way to jot down notes or reminders.  
Instead of switching to another app, this extension lets me capture them directly in VS Code.

## Features
- Simple command available in the Command Palette.  
- Notes are appended as bullet points to `NOTES.md`.  
- Automatically opens the file after writing so you can review or edit.  

## Usage
1. Open a folder in VS Code.  
2. Open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac / `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).  
3. Run **Quick Notes: Add Note**.  
4. Type your note â†’ it appears in `NOTES.md`.

This extension was built as a small productivity helper and also gave me hands-on experience with **VS Code Extension APIs** (commands, input box, and file system).
